Evaluating the System As A whole against specified requirements 

*From start we need to put the exact requirements and outputs intended from each part *

## End To End Testing : 
using the application in a real world use type of way 

interacting with databases(in our example checking classes tutors etc ...) Adding packs to it payment list etc ...
using network 
communications : sending emails , checking notifications etc..

## Black Box Testing : 
it's a software technique in which testing is performed without knowing the internal structure of the system under the test 
* Testers focus on one thing which is the input and the output 

## Smoke Testing :
to verify that basic and critical functionalitites of the system under test is working fine at a very high lvl 

* checks if it's stable 
* plan for detailed lvl of testing 
## Sanity Testing :
* Done on stable builds 
* verify that newly added functionalities of fixed bugs are working just fine 
## Happy Path Testing : 
Tests the valid pretty successfull positive flow , and doesn't look for negative erros (testing should be bright sometimes cmon)

## Monkey Testing : 
* checking if an app crashes by providing random input values/date 
* performed randomly 
* nothing is scripted 
* no need to be aware of all functionalities
* it's as if a monkey is using the app
