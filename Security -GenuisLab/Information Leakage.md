* webserver name that we are running it on (lot of service providers integrate this in HTTP great advertising for them bad for you )
	 it makes the hackers know what ways they shall use which make the range of what they shall use smaller and smaller 

* Url can leak what type of technologies are used like : .php etc..
* Cookies : reveal infos about the server 
* finger-printing tools 
* Error messages : do  not let sensitive details on the error messages
* sanitize html : to not leak server names , adresses etc .. 
* in case of upload , do not leak personal infos
