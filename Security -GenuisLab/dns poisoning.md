DNS poisoning can be used for:

- **Phishing:** Redirecting users to fake websites that mimic legitimate ones to steal sensitive information like login credentials.
- **Monster-in-the-Middle Attacks:** Intercepting and altering communication between two parties, allowing attackers to eavesdrop on or manipulate the data being exchanged.
- **Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS):** Overloading a website or server by directing a massive amount of traffic to a target IP address.
- **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to malicious servers hosting malware, leading to the inadvertent download and installation of malicious software.
